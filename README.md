##Approach:-
The Social Media Content Analyzer application helps users extract and analyze text from documents and social media posts to improve their online engagement. Users can upload PDF files or image files containing text. The app extracts the text clearly using two key technologies: PDF parsing for PDFs, and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for scanned images, while keeping the original formatting intact.

After extracting the text, users can write and analyze social media posts customized for popular platforms like Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook. The app analyzes posts based on length, hashtag usage, and emotional tone, providing simple scores and suggestions to help users create more engaging content.

A special feature is the sentiment analysis, which detects and visualizes emotions like joy, anger, sadness, and surprise within the text. This helps users understand how their content might be perceived emotionally and make it more appealing.

The interface is designed to be clean, user-friendly, and responsive, with options to switch between light and dark themes. Basic error handling and loading indicators ensure smooth user experience.In the future, the AI powered tools can be added.
